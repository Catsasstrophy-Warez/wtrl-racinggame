# 25 --- Does Not Commute

## Why this game is in the top 25

Primary domain: **temporal**. Highest-value extraction: **Temporal
ghosts, deterministic replay as gameplay**.

## Canonical interaction sequence

  Stage                    Observed/target pattern
  ------------------------ -------------------------------------------
  Player intent            Drive a route that becomes future traffic
  Screen state             overhead road network
  Input                    drive one vehicle route
  Selection feedback       timer/path feedback
  Mechanical operation     record route
  Simulation consequence   route becomes moving constraint
  Testing                  next vehicle run
  Persistence              prior routes persist in session

## Screen-by-screen forensic decomposition

### S0 --- Orientation

Record camera framing, vehicle prominence, persistent HUD, current task,
currency/resources, warnings, navigation exits and whether the player
can understand the next meaningful action without opening a manual.

### S1 --- Target acquisition

Record how the player identifies the car, assembly, component, setup
category or event. Capture hover/selection states, occlusion handling,
zoom, focus transitions and invalid targets.

### S2 --- Action selection

Record contextual menus, radial actions, tool selection, tabs, sliders,
steppers, drag gestures, controller bindings and touch hit-target size.

### S3 --- Operation

Record the complete manipulation, not merely its result: animation, tool
pose, fastener/part movement, numeric adjustment, placement snapping,
confirmation, prerequisites and cancellation.

### S4 --- Consequence feedback

Record what changes immediately in the world, HUD, graph, sound,
animation or handling. Separate **previewed consequence** from
**simulated consequence**.

### S5 --- Test loop

Record exact path from modification to proof: next vehicle run. Count
transitions/taps/clicks and identify avoidable friction.

### S6 --- Persistence

Record what survives leaving the screen, returning to garage, restarting
an event, save/reload and application relaunch: prior routes persist in
session.

## WTRL implementation translation

**Canonical truth owner:** WTRLCore subsystem appropriate to `temporal`.

**RealityKit responsibility:** represent physical/spatial state only
where useful; never become a second mechanical truth.

**SwiftUI responsibility:** progressive disclosure, expert data,
comparison, navigation and accessibility.

**Required feedback contract:** selection must have a visible state;
invalid operations explain why; completed operations must expose a
measurable state change.

**Deterministic acceptance test:** Given a fixed initial snapshot and
fixed input/action sequence, assert the resulting canonical state and
persistence payload.

**Player-facing acceptance test:** The player can complete
`Drive a route that becomes future traffic` and reach `next vehicle run`
without encountering an inert control or losing the changed state.

## WTRL prototype to derive

Temporal ghosts, deterministic replay as gameplay.

### Video evidence

A long-form minimally edited source still needs to be selected and
frame-reviewed. This is recorded as `SOURCE_SELECTION_REQUIRED`, not
treated as missing research evidence for the high-level pattern.

## Screenshot capture set

Capture 8 frames: orientation; target selection; action/tool selection;
operation-in-progress; consequence; engineering/detail view; test state;
post-test/persistence state.

## Anti-copy boundary

Extract interaction principles and causal structure only. Do not
reproduce proprietary art, UI trade dress, logos, text, sounds, branded
vehicle assets or distinctive screen composition.
